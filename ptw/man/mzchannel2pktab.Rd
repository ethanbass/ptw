\title{
Conversion between peak lists from hyphenated MS (LCMS, GCMS, ...) data
and input for \code{stptw}.
}
\description{Function pktab2mzchannel allows to split a list of peaks
  into several sublists, for instance on the basis of m/z values. The
  result can be aligned with \code{stptw}. The peak list can be obtained
  from packages like \code{XCMS}. The reverse function,
  mzchannel2pktab, simply gathers all peak positions in one matrix.}
\usage{
pktab2mzchannel(pktab, Ivalue = "maxo", masses = NULL, nMasses = 0, massDigits = 2) 
mzchannel2pktab(mzchannels)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pktab}{a peak table as generated for example by XCMS. Necessary
    information: m/z value (column name "mz"), retention time (column
    name "rt") and intensity.}
  \item{Ivalue}{the name of the intensity value to be used. Default is
    "maxo", one of the columns generated by the XCMS package.}
  \item{masses}{}
